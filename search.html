												The Relationship Between Alcohol and Child Abuse</h2>
											<p>
                        There is a clear connection between excessive alcohol consumption and violent and/or criminal behavior. Evidence of the relationship between the two dates back as far as the 4th century BC. Recently, researchers have clarified alcohols relation to violence, fueled by severely inhibited decision-making. In the US, about a third of inmates were intoxicated upon arrest; half of all domestic abuse involve drinking. The relationship between alcohol and child abuse, specifically, is particularly close, with alcohol abuse being a contributing factor to child abuse and child abuse being a contributing factor to adult alcoholism. Over 1 million children are abused or neglected annually. Over 425,000 of these children were placed into the Child Welfare system.</p>											<h4>
											<h4>
												How Alcoholism Relates to Child Abuse</h4>
											<p>
                        One of the harshest aspects of an alcohol use disorder (AUD) is its effect on the families of those suffering from an addiction. Alcoholism is said to run in families. Of the 14 million Americans with an AUD, nearly half grew up with an alcoholic in their home. Research shows that children who grow up with an alcoholic family member in the household are four times more likely to abuse alcohol as adults.

Alcoholic parents are more likely to neglect children by:

Physically or mentally impairing themselves
Reducing the capacity to respond to a child’s cues and needs
Having difficulty regulating emotional responses
Spending limited funds on alcohol instead of household needs
Spending time seeking out alcohol instead of maintaining responsibilities
Incarceration
Estrangement from family
Children may also be physically or mentally abused by parents who are overly impulsive, aggressive, and violent. This can stunt childrens emotional and physical development, leading to disorders like PTSD.

                        However, if Child Protective Services become aware of any abuse or neglect, they will intervene, investigate the situation, and remove children from potentially dangerous situations if necessary. In extreme cases, termination of parental rights may occur. The Department of Health and Human Services estimates that between one-third and two-thirds of child abuse cases involve some form of substance abuse. Today, just over 1 in 10 children in the US live with a parent who suffers from a substance use disorder (SUD) or dependency; 7.3 million specifically deal with an alcoholic parent.</p>
											<h4>
												Addiction and the Foster Care System</h4>
											<p>
                        The Childrens Bureau lists social isolation, poverty, unstable housing, and domestic violence as reasons children must be removed from homes where substance abuse takes place. In 2012, 31% of children taken from their parents and put into foster care were removed due to alcohol or drug use (some states had rates topping 60%). Of all parents misusing alcohol and drugs, alcoholic parents make up 88% of parents with substance use disorders.</p>
                      
                      <p>Because of the trauma involved in living with an alcoholic parent and that of being removed from ones home, children growing up in foster care are more likely to abuse drugs or alcohol themselves. Nearly half of all foster care youth reported drinking or using an illicit substance within the past six months; 35% qualify as having a SUD. These children are also at higher risk of having a poly-substance use disorder in additional to mental and emotional illnesses that often go untreated.</p>

												<h4>
													Can a bank request me to provide my HKID Card Number for exchanging a HK$500 note for notes of smaller denominations?</h4>
												<p>
													According to the Code of Practice on the Identity Card Number and other Personal Identifiers ("the Code") issued by the Privacy Commissioner, in general, a data user cannot compel an individual to provide his ID card number except with legal authority. Moreover, identity card numbers should not be collected, unless such collection is permitted under the Code. In view that such transaction did not involve substantial risk of money laundering activities, collection of HKID Card numbers was unnecessary.</p>
												<p>
													However, banks are permitted to collect HKID Card copies of their customers as due diligence measures before carrying out a transaction involving an amount equal to or above HK$120,000, and if that is a wire transfer, an amount equal to or above HK$8,000 so as to comply with the relevant requirement in the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) Ordinance.</p>
												<h4>
													Do I need to provide my HKID Card copy to my prospective employer?</h4>
												<p>
													The Code permits a data user to collect the copy of an HKID Card in order to provide proof of compliance with any statutory requirement. An example of such statutory requirement is given under that paragraph in section 17J of the Immigration Ordinance (Cap 115). Employers should not collect HKID Card Copy of job applicants during the recruitment process unless and until the candidate has accepted the offer of employment. Therefore, you are only required to provide your HKID Card Copy upon acceptance of the job offer.</p>

												I have a savings account at "Bank A". Recently I received a phone call from a staff member of this bank marketing its investment products to me. I am really annoyed at this kind of direct marketing calls. How does the Ordinance protect me from the unsolicited approach?</h4>
											<p>
												<span class="bold">Regulation on data protection in direct marketing</span></p>
											<p>
												Part VIA of the Ordinance regulates the use and provision for use of personal data in direct marketing activity.</p>
											<p>
												Data user (Bank A) is required to inform the data subject (you as a client of the bank) certain prescribed information and to obtain his consent. Prescribed information include the notification that the data user intends to use your personal data in direct marketing; that it will not so use your personal data unless it has received your consent or indication of no objection; the kinds of personal data to be used; and the classes of goods, facilities or services that it will promote to you.</p>
											<p>
												The data user should also provide the data subject with a response channel to communicate his consent or indication of no objection. Non-response of the data subject to the data user's notification does not constitute consent or an indication of no objection. The data user cannot use the data subject's personal data in direct marketing unless it has obtained the consent or an indication of no objection from the data subject.</p>
											<p>
												Failure to comply with the new requirements by the data user is a criminal offence punishable by a fine and imprisonment.</p>
											<p>
												<span class="bold">When you receive a marketing message, ask yourself:</span></p>
											<p>
												Had the organisation sent you direct marketing messages before 1 April 2013 regarding the same kind of products it currently promotes, and you had never rejected those messages?</p>
											<p>
												YES – Bank A may invoke the grandfathering provisions of the Ordinance. In which case, it can continue to use your personal data for the purpose of direct marketing the same class of products, without having to inform you of the prescribed information and obtain your consent or indication of no objection.</p>
											<p>
												NO –Bank A may commit a breach of the new requirements if it had not obtained your consent or indication of no objection for using your personal data in direct marketing the current type of products. You may ask Bank A to remedy the breach or lodge a complaint to the PCPD.</p>
											<p>
												<span class="bold">You can opt out at anytime</span></p>
											<p>
												As a data subject, you can opt out from direct marketing at anytime whether or not you have previously consented to receiving direct marketing messages.</p>
											<p>
												Although the Ordinance does not prescribe the manner of how a data subject should raise an opt-out request, the PCPD advises data subject to do so in writing for better protection. You should keep a copy of it which can serve as evidence for future investigation.</p>
											<p>
												If, after you have made an opt-out request and the organisation still keeps on using your personal data for direct marketing purpose, it may have committed an offence under the Ordinance.</p>

												I read from the news that a telephone company would provide its subscribers' telephone numbers and address information to the Fire Services Department ("FSD") to facilitate its handling of emergency calls more efficiently. Has it contravened the Ordinance?</h4>
											<p>
												Having approached both organizations, it was clarified that the telephone company would only provide to FSD the telephone number and installation address of the numbers concerned, i.e. the building or the estate from which the call is made. No full address and name of the subscriber would be disclosed to FSD.</p>
											<p>
												According to section 2 of the Ordinance, personal data means any data relating directly or indirectly to a living individual and from which it is practicable for the identity of the individual to be directly or indirectly ascertained. As the information passed over by the telephone company to FSD do not contain any personal identifying particulars such as name and full address, these data are not regarded as personal data and this arrangement would not be in breach of the Ordinance.</p>

												Can employers monitor employees' e-mails and phone calls?</h4>
											<p>
												Before deciding to monitor, employers should first assess whether it is really necessary to conduct such activity having regard to the business risks that they seek to manage and the impact on personal data privacy of its employees. Employers should consider alternatives available in order to lessen the adverse impact brought by the monitoring activity. In carrying out monitoring, employers should also implement clear Employee Monitoring Policy and communicate it to the staff affected. The use, retention and processing of personal data collected should also be kept under control so as not to contravene the requirements under the Ordinance.</p>

												Can employers of domestic helpers install surveillance cameras at home?</h4>
											<p>
												The same assessment process as mentioned above also applies. Given that the workplace is also the place of rest for the domestic helpers, employers should seriously consider whether it is really necessary to engage in such activity, the reasonableness as well as the openness of the activity. They should therefore inform their helpers of such practice, restrict monitoring to targeted areas (not toilets or other private areas) and make clear the purpose of monitoring and the retention period for the taped records.</p>

												Can government departments install closed-circuit televisions at gambling and hawker blackspots in housing estates, such as pavilions and parks, to tackle the problems?</h4>
											<p>
												We will not comment on individual cases before understanding the specific situation.</p>
											<p>
												According to the Ordinance, "personal data" are any data relating to a living individual, which are stored in recorded form making access to or processing practicable and from which it is practicable for the identity of the individual to be directly or indirectly ascertained from it. Generally speaking, to constitute an act of collection of personal data by the data user, there should be compilation of information about an individual, whose identity must have been identified by the data user, or the data user intends or seeks to identify the identity of the individual.</p>
											<p>
												In general, if a monitoring and recording system is installed in a public place merely for the sake of security, it may not constitute collection of personal data (unless the data of a certain or some particular individuals are collected) and it may not be subject to the Ordinance. However, collection of personal data may take place under some special circumstances. For example, after a special incident has happened, the Authority concerned may need to review the video records for the purpose of ascertaining the identity of the individuals involved in the incident and it may then amount to collection of personal data. Therefore, organizations which intend to install monitoring and recording systems should, at least, post a notice in a prominent position near the installation, stating that the area is being monitored, the purposes of monitoring, as well as the ways of handling the records.</p>
											<p>
												Broadly speaking, organizations can install monitoring and recording systems only if it is necessary for fulfilling their legitimate functions or activities, such as for security reasons, the monitoring of illegal acts (e.g. throwing objects from height, installation of closed-circuit televisions at hygiene blackspots by Team Clean), etc. Before an organization installs a monitoring and recording system, it is suggested that it should establish the collection purposes, evaluate the risks of monitoring, and consider if there is any other substitute that is less privacy intrusive in order to strike a balance between the protection of privacy rights of individuals and the smooth operation of the organizations.</p>
											<p>
												When an organization has decided to install a monitoring and recording system, it is suggested that in the interest of transparency it should post a notice in a prominent position near the installation (the notice should be as close to the installation as practicable; the words should be clear and noticeable) so that sufficient notice is drawn to the public or the people affected hat their activities may be recorded and the reasons for collection of their personal data. The organizations concerned are suggested to formulate policies on video monitoring, and the persons who can access and view the contents of the tapes. Moreover, the organizations should also prescribe the retention period of the tapes and delete the data in the tapes accordingly, and steps shall also be taken to ensure that the tapes are securely kept.</p>
											<p>
												In conclusion, when using monitoring and recording devices in public place, it is our view that a proper balance should be struck between the protection of public interests and personal data privacy. Data users should handle the issue in a fair and transparent manner giving due regards to the rights of personal data privacy.</p>
